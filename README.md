# Blood Group Prediction Using Fingerprint

## Project Overview

This project presents a **non-invasive approach** to blood group prediction using **fingerprint image processing** and **machine learning**. By leveraging **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**, the system classifies fingerprint patterns into **eight common blood groups**: A+, A-, B+, B-, AB+, AB-, O+, and O-. It aims to provide a **quick, accessible, and cost-effective** alternative to traditional blood testing methods.
